               <h2> Objective  <br> <br></h2>
               <p> To build a responsive web recipes app that allows users to search, upload and share drink recipes</p>
               <br> <br>
               <h2> Purpose  <br> <br> </h2>
               <p>The target audience for my app ‘Barista’ is individuals 18-50 who want to make coffee and tea drinks at home. The app will be available across ios and android devices and will be most effectively used while buying ingredients or making drinks</p>
               <br> <br>
               <h2> Project Description  <br> <br></h2>
               <p>Barista is a responsive web app for 18-50-Year-olds that allows users to add, share, and save their favorite coffee and tea recipes </p>
               <br> <br>
               <h2> Role    <br> <br> </h2 >
               <p>  UI/UX Designer <br> <br> </p>
               <br> <br>
               <h2> Skills  <br> <br>  </h2>
               <p> Competitive Analysis, User Research, User Testing, Design Thinking, Visual Design, Wireframing, Prototyping, Mockups, User-Centered Design</p>
               <br> <br>
               <h2> Tools  <br> <br> </h2>
               <p> Adobe XD, Adobe Photoshop, Usability Hub </p>
               <br> <br>
               <h2> MVP ( Minimum Viable Product)   <br> <br> </h2>
               <p> At this point in my project, I had to find a way to optimize my features or practice “lean UX”. I had to think critically alongside my user research about the features that were needed in my app vs the features that were not critical to the functionality of the app.</p>
               <br> <br>
               <h2> Hypothesis  <br> <br>  </h2>
               <p> Users rather make coffee and tea drinks at home because it saves them time and money</p>
               <br> <br>
               <h2> Objective <br> <br> </h2>
               <p>The objective of this research is to build a responsive web app that allows users to search, upload and share drink recipes </p>
               <br> <br>
               <h2>Success Metrics  <br> <br></h2>
               <p>Recipe shares, number of site visits, number of app downloads, number of accounts created</p>
               <br> <br>
               <h2>User Stories and Feature Requirements  <br> <br></h2>
               <h3>When I navigate the app I want to upload a recipe so I can allow others to make my drinks</h3>
               -Support for recipe input
               -Multi-app connectivity
               -Catalog for user-made recipes
               <div>  </div>
               <h3>When I navigate the app I want to search for recipes so I can make new drinks</h3>
               -Search feature
               -Drink catalog
               -Suggested recipes
               <div> </div>
               <h3>When I navigate the app I want to create an account so I can be credited for my uploaded recipes</h3>
               -Form for account creation
               -Create a sense of security for the use
               <h3>When I navigate the app I want to find recipe instructions so I can make my drink step by step</h3>
               -Scroll down instructions under recipes
               <h3>When I navigate the app I want to share a recipe so I can show my family and friends</h3>
               -Social sharing feature
               <br> <br>
               <h2>User Flow</h2>

               </picture>
               <h2>Rapid Prototypes</h2>
               <p>This step further helped me optimize screens for users. It was very helpful to have previously done a user flow. I first completed these prototypes on paper and transferred them on screens as low-fidelity wireframes so my users could understand them better</p>
               <picture><img src="https://i.ibb.co/mHkMqSc/low-fid-1.png" alt="low-fid-1"></picture>
               <h2>User Testing </h2>
               Users testing was the most helpful part of this whole UX process. It really put my designs to the test and allowed me to understand my users frustrations and confusions
               <div></div>
               Scope: I will be testing “Barista” a responsive web app in which signing up/in, uploading and saving, and sharing recipes will be tested.
               <div></div>
               Schedule: I will be meeting my participants remotely via google meet in order to conduct my tests
               <div></div>
               Sessions: I will aim for my sessions to last no longer than 15 minutes per participant(3)
               <div></div>
               Equipment: I will test my low-fidelity wireframes on an Iphone11 prototype, I will use my laptop in order to test users and a notepad to write down behavioral observations
               <div></div>
               Metrics: I will use the 1-5 error severity rating from Jakob Nielsen
               <h2>Jakon Nielsen's Error Severity Rating System</h2>

               <h2>UI Design</h2>
               <p>The user interface design for the Barista app is centered around a youthful and playful approach. To accentuate that look I chose primary colors which are often related to youthful activities. My target audience is very large so I wanted a design that could easily relate to my younger and older users. During my competitive analysis, I realized that many coffee apps usually use colors such as green, brown, and red. I wanted an app my users could easily remember because of its distinct look</p>

               <h3>Voice</h3>
               <p>This voice for the app Barista is whimsical and funny. It goes along with the fun theme of the app, almost childlike. One of the quotes used throughout the app is “a yawn is a silent scream for coffee”</p>

               ''
               Testing more potential users during the user testing phase could be a lot more useful. The more data I get on the app the better I can make it

               <h3>What didn't go well?  <br> <br></h3>
               Rapid prototyping was a bit hard for me, I had all these ideas I wanted to add to my app but ultimately had to stick to the features that would be part of the MVP

               <h3>What went well? <br> <br></h3>
               Asking users early on about preferred features and coffee habits gave me a lot of insight about features I need to focus on as well as A/B testing for visual design elements allowed me to fine-tune design decisions
